# Players' Lounge Login Screen

Using a mockup from Zeplin, the goal is to recreate a login screen as well as the forgot password screen. For the login page, the buttons themselves don't work, but input boxes highlight upon focus. "Forgot password" leads to the forget password page. User will submit their email. As of now, data is hardcoded into an array. Should the user input match a element within the array, nothing will happen (other than a console.log message). Incorrect emails will output an error.
